- Pretty cool initial map, but it's way, way too large to actually use.
- Should be different ways to explore. maybe by geography, larger family tree
- Connect with Wikitongues, system of writing, examples of the language, other resources
- Languages have a FocalPointWgs84 long + lat, would be interesting just to map that.
- Ooh, languages also have a time frame. So could explore throughout history as well.
- Can combine with other data that includes speaker numbers, filter by speaker numbers.
